### LuauDecompiler
This is a simple and weak Luau Decompiler. It is pretty tedious to upgrade so I have decided to release this. Feel free to use this in your projects and try to make it better.
*********************************************************************************

Some info about the current state of the Luau Decompiler.

It currently supports these opcodes.

GetGlobal
Loadk
Call
ClearStack
Return
GetTablek
LoadNumber
LoadBool
Closure
Init
None

The LuaNumber was broken on prpose so users people could figure out how to fix it!
